# LRWRA-3D
This is a 3D representation of the Little Rock Water Reclamation Authority's sewer system. This was created with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) v4.13. 

- <u>Subsurface navigation is enabled</u>: *right-click, hold, and drag the mouse to rotate or change view angle*. 
- Popups are enabled for all features.
- Subsurface depths/elevations of features are *NOT* representative of real world attributes.  Absolute values relative the ground elevation are used for manhole and sewer line depths.

Future enhancements:

- Make feature depths representative of real world attributes.
- Include other infrastructure (pump stations, treatment plants, buildings (?), etc.)
- Render sewer lines based on size.
- Add an expandable information panel.
